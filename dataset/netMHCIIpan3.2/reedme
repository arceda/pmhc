The training binding data are partitioned in 5 files to be used for cross-validation. 
For instance does the train1 file contain training data, and test1 file test data for the first cross-validation partitioning. It is critical that this data partitioning is maintained.

The format for each of the files is

where the first column gives the peptide, the second column the log50k transformed binding affinity (i.e. 1 - log50k( aff nM)), and the last column the class II allele.

When classifying the peptides into binders and non-binders for calculation of the AUC values for instance, a threshold of 500 nM is used. This means that peptides with log50k transformed binding affinity values greater than 0.426 are classified as binders.
